Abstract

The world of art has been revolutionized with the advent of technology, particularly the internet. The online art gallery has become a popular platform for artists to showcase their works and for art enthusiasts to browse and purchase artwork from the comfort of their own homes. In order to manage an online art gallery effectively, an efficient and user-friendly management system is required.

An online art gallery management system is a software solution that enables art gallery owners and administrators to manage their gallery operations more efficiently. The system can provide a range of features to support artwork management, artist management, customer management, order management, payment management, and marketing and analytics.

Artwork management features typically include the ability to add new artwork to the gallery, update artwork details, manage artwork inventory, and display artwork in an online catalogue. Artwork details can include title, artist name, medium, size, price, availability, and other relevant information. The online catalogue can be searchable and filterable by various criteria such as artist name, artwork medium, and price range.

Artist management features can include the ability to add new artists to the gallery, update artist details, manage artist portfolios, and track artist sales and commissions. Artist details can include name, contact information, biography, portfolio, and sales history. Commission tracking can be automated to ensure that artists are paid accurately and promptly.

Customer management features can include the ability to manage customer information, including contact details, order history, payment information, and shipping information. Customer profiles can be created to store this information and provide a centralized location for customer data. Order management features can include the ability to process orders, track order status, and generate invoices.

Payment management features can include the ability to process credit card payments securely, issue refunds, and pay artists their commissions. Payment processing can be integrated with a variety of payment gateways to provide flexibility for customers and gallery owners. Automated payouts can be configured to ensure that artists are paid accurately and on time.

The system can also include auction management features, such as the ability to set up and manage online auctions for selected artworks. Auction details can include the auction start and end dates and times, minimum bid amounts, bid increments, and auto-bidding capabilities.

Scopes of the Project are:-

Artwork management: The system can be designed to manage the artwork in the gallery, including details such as title, artist, medium, size, price, and availability. This can include features such as search and filtering, inventory tracking, and automatic updates to the online catalogue.

Artist management: The system can be designed to manage the artists represented by the gallery, including contact information, portfolio, and sales history. This can include features such as artist profiles, commission tracking, and automated payouts.

Customer management: The system can be designed to manage customer relationships, including contact information, purchase history, and payment details. This can include features such as customer profiles, order tracking, and automated communications.

Order management: The system can be designed to manage the orders placed by customers, including details such as order status, shipping information, and payment processing. This can include features such as order fulfillment, invoicing, and returns processing.

Payment management: The system can be designed to manage the payments made by customers, including credit card processing, refunds, and commission payouts to artists. This can include features such as secure payment processing, automated payouts, and reporting.

Our project is based on Database management.
So, in order to make Database Management System, we have selected 3 languages keeping front-end work in mind and MySQL and PHP in the Backend.

They are: HTML, CSS & Java Script for Frontend.
MySQL and PHP for Backend.
HTML is a language that is used to just put the elements that we want in our web page without keeping in mind the design or presentation of that particular element. 
So, in order to design and beautify our web page, we use style kits like CSS and JS, through which we can take our website presentation to some different level. 
But also, in order to execute this code, we need an IDE (integrated development environment). 
So, for this purpose we have used VsCode. Here various extensions are available to make our execution and debugging very much easy and quick. 
To display the output of our code, we have used Google Chrome as the default web browser. 
The use of a database in an online art gallery management system is crucial for the efficient management of data related to artwork, artists, customers, orders, and payments. 
A database provides a structured and organized way to store and manage data, making it easier to search, retrieve, and manipulate information as needed. 
And for this purpose, we need Xampp to host the server and MySQL to create the database and PHP is a versatile and powerful tool that can be used in a variety of ways to develop and manage an online art gallery.
