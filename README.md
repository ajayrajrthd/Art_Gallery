Online art gallery management system is a software solution that enables art gallery owners and administrators to manage their gallery operations more efficiently. The system can provide a range of features to support artwork management, artist management, customer management, order management, payment management, and marketing and analytics.

Artwork management features typically include the ability to add new artwork to the gallery, update artwork details, manage artwork inventory, and display artwork in an online catalogue. Artwork details can include title, artist name, medium, size, price, availability, and other relevant information. The online catalogue can be searchable and filterable by various criteria such as artist name, artwork medium, and price range.

Artist management features can include the ability to add new artists to the gallery, update artist details, manage artist portfolios, and track artist sales and commissions. Artist details can include name, contact information, biography, portfolio, and sales history. Commission tracking can be automated to ensure that artists are paid accurately and promptly.

Customer management features can include the ability to manage customer information, including contact details, order history, payment information, and shipping information. Customer profiles can be created to store this information and provide a centralized location for customer data. Order management features can include the ability to process orders, track order status, and generate invoices.

Payment management features can include the ability to process credit card payments securely, issue refunds, and pay artists their commissions. Payment processing can be integrated with a variety of payment gateways to provide flexibility for customers and gallery owners. Automated payouts can be configured to ensure that artists are paid accurately and on time.

The system can also include auction management features, such as the ability to set up and manage online auctions for selected artworks. Auction details can include the auction start and end dates and times, minimum bid amounts, bid increments, and auto-bidding capabilities.
